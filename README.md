# SCLAB5
In this lab, we had to implement 2 functions using the test-first programming strategy.
We made the test cases for "GuessFollowsGraph" and "Influencers"
In the GuessFollowsGraph, we had to guess who follows who on twitter using the usernames a person mentioned in his tweets.
Most influenced people are determined by the number of followers on twitter.
